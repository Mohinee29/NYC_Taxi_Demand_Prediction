# NYC_Taxi_Demand_Prediction
Business Problem

For a given location in New York City, the goal is to predict  number of pickups  around that location. Some locations require more number of taxis at peak hours considering a number of factors in that location. By viewing the prediction, the taxi drivers can move to that particular location for increased number of pickups.


Source of Data

Objectives & Constraints

Objectives: 

Our objective is to predict the number of pickups as accurately as possible for each region in a 10min interval. We will break up the whole New York City into regions. Now, the 10min interval is chosen because in NYC one can commute 1 mile in approximately 10 minutes given the traffic is normal at that particular time.

Constraints:

Latency: There is a medium latency requirement ranging from few seconds to minutes.

Interpretability: There is a no interpretability required.A taxi driver is only concerned with the accurate prediction results.

Relative Errors: Mean Absolute Percentage Error will be the relative error we will consider. Our goal is to reduce the percentage error is low as possible.
